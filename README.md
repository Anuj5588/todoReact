# React TODO App

A simple TODO list application built with React that allows you to add, complete, and delete tasks. It also includes features like selecting and deselecting all tasks and resetting the task list.

## Features

- **Add Todo**: You can add a new task to the list by entering a description and pressing the "Add" button or hitting the "Enter" key.

- **Complete Todo**: Click on a task to mark it as complete. Completed tasks will be displayed with a strike-through style.

- **Delete Todo**: Each task includes a "Delete" button that allows you to remove it from the list.

- **Select/Deselect All**: Click the "Select All" button to mark all incomplete tasks as complete or click it again to deselect all tasks.

- **Reset**: The "Reset" button clears the entire task list, returning it to its initial state.

- **Offline Functionality**: The app functions like a regular offline application. Even if you refresh the page or perform a hard refresh, the state of the app remains unchanged.
